# SoftwareEngineeringGroup
Our product is Junk Box! A subscription that offers clients the ability to pick specific eBay searches, to yield a random result every month, week, or day! These results will cost between $1 and $5, and will be shipped straight to the customer. Our target audience is anyone who loves to open packages, which is a large portion of the population. We are solving the problem of subscription services like Bombfell or Lootcrate that ship junk, at over twice the cost!
